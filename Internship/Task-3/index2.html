        <h3>GL Scheme of Training for PN Regular Entry Cadets</h3>
        <p>
          Pakistan Navy has always been alive to train its manpower in
          accordance with the dictates of the time. The training curricula in
          PN, in particular the officers training schemes, have undergone a
          radical transformation to meet the challenges of 21st century.
          Henceforth, the new breed of officers’ corps will be either
          Engineering Graduates or holders of BBA (Hons) degrees. At the Naval
          Academy, the cadets spend three terms of six months each and are
          taught various academic and professional subjects providing them a
          firm base to undertake their future professional and degree courses
          available in various PN professional schools.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the Academy cadets are taught subjects in three major disciplines:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Humanities/Academics</li>

          <h3>Training Establishments: PNS Rahbar</h3>
          <p>
            Pakistan Naval Academy is the home of initial training of officers
            of Pakistan Navy. It has also provided basic training to about 2000
            officers of Allied Navies. It can proudly claim that the Chief of
            Naval Staff of Qatar Emiri Navy and many high ranking officers of
            Royal Saudi Navy as well as other navies in the Gulf are graduates
            of PNA.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Naval Academy gives professional, moral, educational, mental and
            physical training to the subordinate officers of the Navy, so that,
            with time and experience, they develop into proficient Naval
            officers equipped with the highest ideals of loyalty, honour,
            courage and devotion to duty, which would be in conformity with the
            past Islamic history and future aspiration of the people of
            Pakistan.

        <div class="bg admission-criteria">
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            At the outset in 1947, when Pakistan born as a sovereign state, the
            Pakistan Navy had only a few ships. The lack of expertise at that
            time, left Pakistan Navy with no option but to send its officers,
            for training to Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth in UK.
            Though the training at Dartmouth was considered beneficial, but our
            cultural differences and divergent operational requirements
            compelled us to start our own training in Pakistan, with whatever
            meagre resources were available. The training for Naval Officers in
            Pakistan was incepted in 1960 by establishing the Academy on board
            PNS BABUR, a Dido Class Cruiser of Second World War vintage. In
            1965, PNS BABUR was required for operational duties and cadets'
            training was shifted to a part of the present premises. By 1970, the
            officers training needs increased substantially due to own
            requirements as well as to cater for the training of a large number
            of officers from brotherly Muslim Countries. This necessitated the
            establishment of an independent training institution. Hence, in
            December 1970, Pakistan Naval Academy was commissioned as PNS RAHBAR
            at Manora. Since then, the Academy is fulfilling primary training
            requirements of officers of Pakistan Navy and other Muslim
            countries, such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Palestine,
            Turkmenistan, Lebanon, Iran, Ghana, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya and Oman.
            Up till now a total of 1912 officers from friendly countries have
            been trained in PNA. The PNA is the first Armed Forces Academy,
            which is ISO 9001: 2000 certified.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Academy got the status of degree awarding institute in 1965 and
            the degree of BSc (NA) was used to be given. In 1990, the Academy
            was affiliated to Karachi University for award of BSc (Hons) degree
            in Naval Sciences to Naval officers. The same status continued till
            July 1997. After that, split BE programme started in which cadets
            are required to complete 36 credit hours at the Academy credited
            towards BE degree programmes conducted at PNEC and degree is awarded
            by National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST). Whereas
            officers in the Logistic Branch get BBA (Hons) degree from IBA.
